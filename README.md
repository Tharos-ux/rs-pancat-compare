# rs-pancat-compare

This repo contains a RUST version of a pangenome graph distance algorithm implementation.
(Work in progress)

> [!NOTE]\
>  [pancat compare](https://github.com/Tharos-ux/pancat) is a tool, originally written in Python, designed to compute a distance between pangenome graphs made from a same group of genomes. 

I'm not a Rust developper and this might be suboptimized. However I feel sharing it is good as it achieves a >4x time reduction to its Python equivalent (human chromosome 21 = 3min against 13 for python implementation).
